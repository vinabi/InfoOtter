-------------------------------------------------------------
Artificial Intelligence (AI) is expanding with colossal applications in various sectors. In the healthcare sector, it is booming to make life simpler with utmost accuracy by predicting, diagnosing and up to care with the help of Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) applications. Modern computer algorithms have attained accuracy levels comparable to those of human specialists in medical sciences, although computers often do jobs more quickly than people do. It is also expected that there will not be a mandate for humans to be present for the jobs that machines can do, and it is gaining the highest peak because of good trained artificial models in the medical field. ML enhances the therapeutic process and improves health by encouraging more patient participation. ML may get more accurate patient data when used with the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) and automate message notifications that prompt patients to respond at certain times. The motivation behind this article is to make a comprehensive review of the on-going implementation of ML in medical science, what challenges it is facing now, and how it can be simplified for future researchers to contribute better to medical sciences while applying it to the practitioners' jobs easier. In this review, we have extensively mined the data and brought up systematised applications of AI in healthcare, what challenges have been faced by the experts, and what ethical responsibilities are liable to them while taking the data. We also tabulated which algorithms will be helpful for what kind of data and disease conditions will be useful for future researchers and developers. This article will provide a better insight into AI and ML for the beginner to the advanced developer and researcher to understand the concepts from the basics.

----------------------------------------------------------------
In 1959, Arthur Samuel, a renowned computer scientist, defined ML as the "computer's ability to learn without being explicitly programmed". As it completes task T with a performance measure P, a computer program learns from experience E. The task performance improves with experience [[1](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10484692/#R01), [2](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10484692/#R02)]. For simplicity, we can take an example of the checkers game, where the program learns good and bad positions to win a game through experience gained by playing against itself. ML is a sub-domain of AI, which aims to build machines as intelligent as a human brain. Algorithms are collections of mathematical operations that define the connections between variables and are the foundation of ML techniques. The ML dataset is divided into training and testing data. The division is done in a ratio of 80:20 (training: testing) and runs simultaneously [[3](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10484692/#R03)]. To note, the training data is used for evaluation purposes, and testing data is used for validation purposes. ML encompasses various learning methods broadly classified into supervised and unsupervised learning.
[](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10484692/)Supervised Learning:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Supervised ML (supervised ML) refers to methods where a model is trained on various inputs or features connected to a known outcome. For example, in medicine, a model can be trained to a person's lifestyle features (like smoking, eating habits, exercise) to a particular onset of disease, say suppose, diabetes [[4](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10484692/#R04)]. After dividing the data and training the algorithm, the model is now prepared to predict the early onset of diabetes. The predictions made by the trained model can be discrete (0 or 1, positive or negative) or continuous (values can be in decimals). The model which gives discrete predictions is called classification, and the one which gives continuous prediction values is called regression [[4](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10484692/#R04), [5](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10484692/#R05)]. Classification-related issues are relatively common in medicine. In many clinical circumstances, a doctor's diagnosis of a patient involves classifying the illness based on a particular collection of symptoms. Forecasting numerical results, such as the projected duration of hospital stay, given a specific collection of data, such as vital signs, medical history, and weight, is a common focus of regression concerns.
[](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10484692/)Unsupervised Learning:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Unsupervised learning has no predetermined results (labels). Without human input, computers search for patterns in unsupervised learning, which is also exploratory and used to locate murky groupings or patterns in datasets. These techniques are usually called dimension reduction, including factor analysis and principal component analysis. The most common and well-known techniques are K-means clustering and DL, while DL may also be used in a supervised environment [[4](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10484692/#R04)]. These algorithms also do association tasks that resemble clustering. These methods are unsupervised since no human input is provided on which set of attributes the clusters should be focused on. The increasing adoption of ML in many industries, including healthcare, has been made possible by advancements in data technologies, including storage capacity, computing power, and data transport speeds [[6](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10484692/#R06)]. The difficulties of delivering appropriate healthcare to everyone have been underlined by contemporary medical developments, which emphasise the necessity for a "precision medicine" or personalised medicine approach to healthcare. Personalised medicine seeks to find, anticipate, and analyse diagnostic choices using enormous amounts of healthcare data so that physicians can subsequently apply them to each patient [[7](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10484692/#R07)]. A few examples of the information that might be used include data on a person's genes or family history, medical imaging data, medication combinations, patient health outcomes at the community level, and natural language processing of prior medical records. The development of alternative staffing models and IP capitalisation, the provision of competent healthcare, the reduction of administrative and supply costs, and the vital roles they play in patient care, billing, and medical records are all made possible by technology today. One such subject that is gradually gaining traction in the healthcare sector is ML. To detect malignant tumours in mammograms, Google recently built a machine-learning system. Stanford University researchers now use DL to detect skin cancer [[8](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10484692/#R08), [9](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10484692/#R09)]. ML is already helping in various healthcare scenarios. Numerous more applications of ML in healthcare include providing exact resource allocation, timely risk assessments, and analysis of hundreds of distinct data points to suggest outcomes. A few applications are listed in Figure 1(see PDF).
The term "medical imaging" refers to a range of techniques used to create pictures of the inside of the human body for use in the diagnosis, analysis, and medical intervention. This is one of the three main applications of ML. The need for exploratory surgery, a discredited clinical standard, is reduced or eliminated. Since accessing any area of the human body by surgery raises the risk of infections, strokes, and other complications, medical imaging is currently the advised way for early diagnosis in the clinical environment [[10](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10484692/#R10), [11](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10484692/#R11)]. Medical Imaging- Lesion and automated computer detection are discovered in body scans such as mammography and brain scans. On the other hand, scanning these documents and incorporating the generated pictures into a database are two methods used in medical records' natural language processing (NLP) to extract meaningful information from the free text [[12](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10484692/#R12), [14](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10484692/#R14)]. They include image processing as well as recognising ideas and phrases. In handwritten medical records, complaints from patients, observations made by the doctor, and family history are all recorded. This medical information may be annotated. However, due to the doctor's shoddy writing, it could be challenging to identify this information correctly. Although there is still a risk of missing data, analysing language in pre-structured forms and papers is simpler. Cases of NLP: A recent study published in Nature Communications employed machine learning approaches to automatically gather GWAS data from open-access journals and extract GWAS associations into a database to assist curators [[15](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10484692/#R15), [16](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10484692/#R16)]. Despite mixed findings (60-80% recall and 78-94% precision), this is just one of the various ways NLP is used to advance medical research. A different study used NLP to categorise risk-stratify individuals with cirrhosis. This research could identify cirrhosis patients using electronic health data, ICD-9 code combinations, and radiological imaging with a 95.71 sensitivity and 93.88 specificities. Jenni Sidey-Gibbons (2019) observed that medical researchers and physicians are very interested in ML methods in the article "ML in medicine" [[4](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10484692/#R04)]. The researchers showed how to accurately categorise tumour samples as benign or malignant using three widely used algorithms: a regularised general linear model, artificial neural networks and support vector machines (SVM) [[4](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10484692/#R04)]. The algorithm can predict outcomes when used with new data after it has successfully been trained. The assessment and validation samples were chosen randomly from the publicly accessible breast mass sample dataset. Before they were used to forecast the diagnostic result in the validation dataset, the algorithms were trained on data from the evaluation sample. The trained algorithms had high specificity (.99), sensitivity (.99), and accuracy (.94â€“.96) when classifying cell nuclei (.85 - .94). The SVM technique produced the highest accuracy (.96) and area under the curve (.97). When algorithms were grouped into a voting ensemble, prediction performance somewhat improved (accuracy=.97, sensitivity =.99, specificity =.95) [[4](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10484692/#R04), [17](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10484692/#R17)]. Figure 2 (see PDF) shows how AI can be implemented in cancer diagnosis with the highest accuracy.
